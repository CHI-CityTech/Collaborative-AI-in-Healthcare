# Collaborative-AI-in-Healthcare

<!-- Replace [Project Title] with your actual research project name -->

## Project Overview
This project is speculative but grounded. It will demonstrate how today’s examples of AI in healthcare may foreshadow tomorrow’s collaborative partnerships. By analyzing both past, present, and potential future pratices of AI in Healthcare, the research will help healthcare managers and policy thinkers anticipate how privacy, ethics, and professional practice may need to change accordingly. 

**Research Focus**: This study aims to examine how artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being used in healthcare and speculates on how its role may evolve as technology grows more powerful. The goal is not to catalog every existing application, but rather to demonstrate representative examples of AI in current practice and then imagine how these early forms of collaboration might deepen into more integrated models of team based healthcare. By situating AI within the context of HIPAA compliance and patient privacy, the project highlights both the opportunities and the risks of integrating AI into clinical work.
